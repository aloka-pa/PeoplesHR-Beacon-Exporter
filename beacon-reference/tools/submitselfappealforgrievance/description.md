# submitSelfAppealForGrievance

**Task:** Submit an Appeal for an Existing Grievance

**Tags:** Grievance, Aloka, phase3

**Status:** live

## Description

Submits an appeal for a grievance the employee has already submitted. originalRecHeadCode, originalEmpNumber, and originalTempHeadCode must come from a prior getMyGrievanceHistory result - never ask the user for these. comment is required and must always be asked of the user. The tool always previews first (channel members and any requested bypasses, comment, hide-identity) and only actually submits when called again with confirmed:true. DRAFT: the new appeal recHeadCode bootstrap and GetTemplateChannelDetails pageName are best-guess extrapolations from submitMyGrievanceApplication, not yet independently confirmed - see description.md.

## Arguments

_None._


## Advanced arguments

- `originalRecHeadCode` (string, required) — The recHeadCode of the grievance being appealed, taken from a getMyGrievanceHistory (or getMyGrievanceHistoryFullDetails) result. Do not ask the user for this - resolve the grievance by name/date first if needed.
- `originalEmpNumber` (string, required) — The (encrypted) empNumber of the grievance being appealed, taken from the same getMyGrievanceHistory result as originalRecHeadCode. Do not ask the user for this.
- `originalTempHeadCode` (string, required) — The tempHeadCode of the grievance being appealed, taken from the same getMyGrievanceHistory result as originalRecHeadCode. Do not ask the user for this.
- `comment` (string, required) — The employee's comment/reason for appealing this grievance. Required - always ask the user for this before submitting.
- `hideIdentity` (boolean, optional) — Set true if the user wants to appeal anonymously, hiding their identity from the channel members handling it. Optional, defaults to false.
- `bypassChannelMembers` (array, optional) — Names (or employee numbers) of assigned channel members the user wants to bypass/skip for this appeal, matched against the channel member list this tool previews. Optional - omit to keep every channel member in the escalation chain.
- `confirmed` (boolean, optional) — Set true only after the user has seen the preview this tool returns (channel members and any bypassed ones, comment, hide-identity) and has explicitly agreed to submit. Omit or set false to preview without submitting anything - this is the default and safe to call repeatedly while the user is still deciding.
